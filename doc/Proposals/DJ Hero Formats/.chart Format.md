Note types marked with an asterisk (\*) are required for full compatibility with the DJ Hero 2 feature set. All other note types are extensions of the the DJ Hero 2 feature set, and are defined in order to give an engine the option to use them.

Open notes are notes that require no buttons to be pressed.

Crossfades will automatically become spike crossfades if their length is a 1/16th note or less. These spikes can be forced as regular crossfades by using the spike/non-spike swap note. Regular fades can also be forced as spikes regardless of their length.

The sample used in a freestyle sample/scratch is determined by a corresponding or prior `dj_sample` local event.

The effect type for effect zones is determined by a corresponding or prior `dj_effect` local event.

### Turntable Local Events

| Event Text                  | Description |
| :---------                  | :---------- |
| `dj_effect <name>`          | Specifies the audio effect to be used by a corresponding effect zone.<br>`name` is the name of the effect to be used. |
| `dj_sample <number> [lane]` | Specifies a sample number to be used by a corresponding freestyle sample/scratch zone.<br>`number` is the number of the sample to use, as specified in the `[Song]` section.<br>`lane` is an optional parameter to implement & use that specifies the lane a sample should apply to, for cases where multiple lanes are in use.<br>The engine playing the chart may extend this event to apply to other notes, e.g. use samples as tap/scratch hitsounds. |
