# .chart Brief History

Paraphrased and extended from [FireFox's .chart specifications](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v2v0U-9HQ5qHeccpExDOLJ5CMPZZ3QytPmAG5WF0Kzs/edit?usp=sharing):

In the early days of Guitar Hero, a ScoreHero user by the name of Turkeyman collaborated with several members of the ScoreHero community to reverse-engineer the original Guitar Hero 1 archive format.
Soon after, a user by the name Katamakel developed a user interface to rebuild these archives, while Turkeyman worked on an editor to modify the data contained within them. This later turned into Feedback Editor.

Support for Feedback Editor dropped around the release of Guitar Hero 3 due to Turkeyman aiming to develop the program into a fully standalone game.
Remnants of this can be seen with the inclusion of the Drums and Keys track in Feedback Editor, which were implemented before Guitar Hero: World Tour or Rock Band were announced.
There was also a secondary version of the .chart file format in development for this game known as .chart-v2.
This format would have addressed the current limitations that came with designing the original .chart format for GH1/2, but it was never adopted by the community due to it only being available in Turkeyman’s game, which never released.

Modding for Guitar Hero 3 also hit a standstill at this time due to increased security within the game’s code.
It wasn’t until the PC release of GH3 that the modding scene picked up again, spawning Guitar Hero Three Control Panel, which became the main modding tool for the game.
Soon after Guitar Hero: World Tour and Rock Band were announced, development for Feedback dropped entirely.

The .chart format was later updated to support GH3 mods by ExileLord, such as tap notes and open notes.
Due to Feedback’s outdated nature, these mechanics had to be implemented using workarounds that were extremely tedious and prone to errors and crashes.
It was also around this time that Moonscraper Chart Editor began development by FireFox in order to re-support the .chart format and the new mods with it, as well as make the charting process easier and more accessible.

Over time, people found exhaustion in the entire modding process for GH3, and soon a fan-game called Clone Hero began development by a user named srylain.
This game read the entire .chart file format directly into the game, which made playing custom Guitar Hero songs much more accessible, as it avoided any complicated game modification processes.
Clone Hero would go on to implement its own mechanics into the .chart file format, such as the format for lyrics by mdsitton, Guitar Hero Live track data, and drums cymbal marking/SP activation phrases.

Even today, the format continues to evolve.
There were new features added to bring drums to parity with what's available in the .mid format, and a new proposal for DJ Hero tracks within .chart files has been made from the DJ Hero community.
Despite all this though, others have gripes with the format, and some want to create a new format free of the burdens of past mistakes, both of the format itself, and of specifications made for some of the tracks.
The ultimate fate of the .chart format remains to be seen.
