For whatever reason, there are vocalist animation notes on this track. For these notes, the vocalist's mouth opens on the note on, and closes on the note off.

- There may be some other mechanism that controls this, but this is what the current sources say.

*May not actually be part of the range? But it would make sense to go to 20 and not a more arbitrary 19

Notes marked with the "big note" marker will make the crowd react negatively to missing those notes. These notes are marked individually, not as a phrase.

*Same deal as the GH1 ANIM track; this note might not actually be valid in GH1/2.

## Common Note Mechanics

Notes are strum notes by default. They get turned into HOPOs (hammer-ons/pull-offs) automatically if they are close enough to the previous note, unless they are the same lane as the previous note, or are a chord. This threshold is 170 ticks in GH1 (all Harmonix GH games use a resolution of 480).

Sustains shorter than 160 ticks are cut off and turned into a normal (non-sustain) note.

Chords are all forced to be the same length, regardless of what's in the .mid file.

Notes with a position difference of 10 ticks or less get snapped together as a chord, with the position to snap to being the start position of the earliest note within the chord.

## Common Phrase Mechanics

Star Power phrases mark sections of the chart where the player may gain Star Power. When Star Power is activated, points gained from notes are doubled (this applies on top of the standard combo multiplier), and health gained from hit notes drastically increases.

- Star Power is marked per-difficulty in Guitar Hero 1 and 2, something which has not made it over to the standard .mid format.

Face-Off phrases designate a section of the chart to be played in a face-off/versus mode by one or both players. In this mode, players play against each other, trading off between sections or playing at the same time.

- These phrases are marked per-difficulty in Guitar Hero 1 and 2, something which has not made it over to the standard .mid format.
