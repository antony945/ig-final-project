## Track Notes

Some notes are used on this track for practice mode assist samples:

| MIDI Note | Description                        |
| :-------: | :----------                        |
| 26        | Hi-hat practice mode assist sample |
| 25        | Snare practice mode assist sample  |

These samples (presumably, at least) play in Practice Mode alongside an isolated stem when the speed is set below 100%. Needs checking.
