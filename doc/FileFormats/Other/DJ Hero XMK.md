# DJ Hero .xmk Format

This document mostly serves as an informational warning.

Most of the early DJ Hero custom charts were made directly using DJ Hero's internal .xmk format. For best support of this content, it may be worth considering supporting this format.

For information on the .xmk format, visit the [AnyDir page](https://anydir.github.io/?a=formats/official/xmkandfsgmub) on it.
